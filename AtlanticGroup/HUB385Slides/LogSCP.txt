If you have specific technical questions, you can ask them: how?

Give a video pitch which lasts for about 3 minutes (not more). It should show a 
Minimum Viable Product (not a mock up or wireframe).

There will be 5 winners in the business case phase (called partner phase) and 5 
winners in "pitch your own idea and solution" phase (called international phase).

All solutions should be developed using SAP technologies.


### SAP Cloud Platform

Platform as a service. SAP Cloud runs in many different data centers, not only
SAP data centers. Bimodal (origin of the term? meaning of the term?), mode one
and mode two applications. We are developing mode two applications.

Make a better UI. The new SAP UI is called Fiori.
Fiori: users will only see the functionality that they need to see; runs 
transactional data and (? didn't catch it) data together.

Companies that make use of SAP technologies:

glu (mobile game company) uses SAP Big Data technologies to improve User 
Experience (UX) by looking at all kinds of data collected through their 
applications (which avatars are purchased, which games are downloaded the most, 
with which functionalities does the user engage the most and many more).

Shop Up: detects where customers go in their store.

IoT solutions: precision agriculture, sync traffic lights to let ambulances 
through and many more.

Waberer's Optimum Solution/Pirelli: a very similar problem to Atlantic Groups 
problem; truck cargo fleet management, analysis and driver control.

Semos: gamification; employees can rate one another and buy items 
from the store with earned points.

postNL: exposes data to e-commerce websites.

apollogic: reports fiscal data towards Polish Fiscal Authority.

You can bring data from the on-premise database to the cloud using a Cloud 
Connector. Cloud Connectors create a VPN between the Cloud and the on-premise 
system.
?A destination is what connects to the cloud.
?Trust management and authorization.

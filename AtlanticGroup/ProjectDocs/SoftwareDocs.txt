## Project documentation

### Problems

P1) Atlantic Group has to process, validate and store a large volume of 
superfluous physical papers.

P2) Atlantic Group is notified about the delivery being turned down (due to 
being late) too late. 

P3) Customers and Atlantic Group employees don't see the state of the goods 
delivery in the supply chain process.
 
P4) Atlantic Group doesn't process customer complaints.

P5) Atlantic Group doesn't track the travel time between locations, time spent 
on each delivery step, delivery sequence or any other useful piece of 
information produced during the goods delivery.

P6) Phone calls between the truck drivers and the dispatching service or the 
forwarding agent ("expedition" stands for "shpedicija") take a long time.

### Requirements and functionalities

A) "Better delivery status tracking": customers and Atlantic Group employees 
should see the current status of deliveries.

B) "Display planned routes and key information to drivers": external and internal 
drivers should see the driving directions (and other key information?).

C) "Real time confirmation of delivery": when the customer signs the delivery
note, the central system should receive the message.

D) "Communication with dispatching service": drivers and dispatchers should 
communicate using a method other then by a phone call.

E) "Digital customer complaint ("reclamation") and correctional documents": 
customer complaints should be handled automatically and digitally.

F) "Avoid numerous phone calls to dispatcher and forwarding agent ("expedit" is 
not a word) about delivery status": subsumed under D).

G) "Analysis capabilities": gather data and provide the means to analyse it.

1) "External availability of order status information": subsumed under A).

2) "Complete visibility of order delivery status": subsumed under A).

3) "Possibility to complete delivery information": customer can digitally sign a 
delivery note.

4) "Initiate customer complaints": subsumed under E).

5) Note: "... all requested ERP integration features should initially be provided 
through simple export in some database table."

6) "Customers should have access to current order processing status": subsumed 
under A)

7) "Customer can choose to get email alerts when order status changes": customers 
can select deliveries from which they want to receive emails if the delivery 
status changes.

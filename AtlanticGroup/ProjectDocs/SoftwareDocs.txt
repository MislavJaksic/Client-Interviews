## Project documentation

### Problems

P1) Atlantic Group has to process, validate and store a large volume of 
superfluous physical papers.

P2) Atlantic Group is notified about the delivery being turned down (due to 
being late) too late. 

P3) Customers and Atlantic Group employees don't see the state of the goods 
delivery in the supply chain process.
 
P4) Atlantic Group doesn't process customer complaints.

P5) Atlantic Group doesn't track the travel time between locations, time spent 
on each delivery step, delivery sequence or any other useful piece of 
information produced during the goods delivery.

P6) Phone calls between the truck drivers and the dispatching service or the 
forwarding agent ("expedition" stands for "shpedicija") take a long time.

### Requirements and functionalities

A) "Better delivery status tracking": customers and Atlantic Group employees 
should see the current status of deliveries.

B) "Display planned routes and key information to drivers": external and internal 
drivers should see the driving directions (and other key information?).

C) "Real time confirmation of delivery": when the customer signs the delivery
note, the central system should receive the message about the event.

D) "Communication with dispatching service": drivers and dispatchers should 
communicate using a method other then by a phone call.

E) "Digital customer complaint ("reclamation") and correctional documents": 
customer complaints should be handled automatically and digitally.

F) "Avoid numerous phone calls to dispatcher and forwarding agent ("expedit" is 
not a word) about delivery status": subsumed under D).

G) "Analysis capabilities": gather data and provide the means to analyse it.

## Client Interviews

A collection of all the notes, pictures and documentation that I produced during or after talking with a client.

### [Atlantic Group](https://www.atlantic.hr/en/)

As a SAP Technical Consultant, I willingly took on the duties of a notetaker. During Atlantic Group's business case
presentation I wrote down what was said but did not appear on the slides. These notes where later used in discussions
with my team mates. I also took pictures of the presentations. This way, we did not have to wait for the presentations
to be published, as we already had them, speeding up the project. Both the notes and the pictures were later used in
the analysis of Atlantic Group's problem.

We had multiple team meetings during which we discussed the business case. We drew a few diagrams of how the different
program parts are going to interact. We also discussed how we are going to design the interface. I took pictures of both.
After we analysed the problem I took the liberty of creating a project charter, work breakdown structure (WBS) and
software documentation.

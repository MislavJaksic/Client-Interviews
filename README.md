## Client Interviews

A collection of notes, pictures and software/project documentation that I have produced during or after talking
with an external or internal client.

### [Atlantic Group](https://www.atlantic.hr/en/)

During Atlantic's business case presentation I took on the responsibilities of a notekeeper. I paid careful
attention to what was being said and took down notes. Because I didn't know when Atlantic would publish their
slideshow I took pictures of every single slide. The pictures came in handy during our team meetings as by that
time Atlantic didn't publish their slideshow which speedup our development process. Additionally, the notes made
sure we interpreted Atlantic's specifications and requirements correctly.

We had multiple team meetings during which we discussed the business case. We drew diagrams of how parts of
the program were going to interact with each other. We also discussed how we are going to design the interface.
I took pictures of both. After we analysed the problem I took the liberty of creating a project charter,
work breakdown structure (WBS) and software documentation.

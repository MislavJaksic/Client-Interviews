### Atlantic Group

During my employment as a SAP Technical Consultant one of the duties I undertook was to take notes during a business
case presentation made by Atlantic Group, so that I could discuss them with my team mates. I also took pictures of
the presentation, so that we don't have to wait for the organisers to put up the presentations online for us to start
analysing Atlantic Group's problem.

After the problem was analysed I took the liberty of creating a project charter, work breakdown structure (WBS) and
the software documentation. During one of the meetings I took pictures of the whiteboard upon which we drew how is 
the interface going to look like as well as how the different users are going to interact with the programs.

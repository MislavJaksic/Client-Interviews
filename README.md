## Client Interviews

Contains notes, pictures, program and project documentation produced during external or internal client interviews.  

### [Atlantic Group](https://www.atlantic.hr/en/)

During Atlantic's business case presentation I decided to be a notekeeper.  
I paid careful attention to the presentation and took down notes.  

Atlantic said they would publish the slideshow, but not when if would be available.  
I didn't want to dependent on Atlantic so I took pictures of the slides with my phone.  
These slides came in handy because our team was able to begin discussing the requirements right away.  
Notes also gave the slides context which made interpreting Atlantic's problem a lot easier.  

We had multiple team meetings during which we discussed the business case.  
We drew diagrams of how parts of the program were going to interact with each other.  
We also discussed how we are going to design the interface.  
I took pictures of both.  
After we analysed the problem I took the liberty of creating a project charter, work breakdown structure (WBS) and software documentation.  

### Candidate Interviews

Job applicants could be considered external clients. If we stretch the definition.

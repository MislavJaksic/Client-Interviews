## Client Interviews

A collection of notes, pictures and program/project documentation that I have produced while talking to an
external or internal client.  

### [Atlantic Group](https://www.atlantic.hr/en/)

During Atlantic's business case presentation I took on the responsibilities of a notekeeper.  
I paid careful attention to what the presenter said and took down notes.  
Because I didn't know when Atlantic would publish their slideshow I also took pictures of many slide.  
The pictures came in handy because my team could begin discussing the requerments right away.  
Additionally, the notes made sure we interpreted Atlantic's specifications and requirements correctly.  

We had multiple team meetings during which we discussed the business case.  
We drew diagrams of how parts of the program were going to interact with each other.  
We also discussed how we are going to design the interface.  
I took pictures of both.  
After we analysed the problem I took the liberty of creating a project charter, work breakdown structure
(WBS) and software documentation.

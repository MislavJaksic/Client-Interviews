## Client Interviews

A collection of notes, pictures and program/project documentation that I have produced as a result of talking
to an external or internal client.  

### [Atlantic Group](https://www.atlantic.hr/en/)

During Atlantic's business case presentation I decided to be a notekeeper.  
I paid careful attention to what the presenter said and took down notes.  
Because I didn't know when Atlantic would publish their slideshow I also took pictures of almost all slides.  
The pictures came in handy because my team could then begin discussing the requirements right away instead of waiting for Atlantic to publish the slideshow.  
Additionally, the notes gave the slides context which made interpreting Atlantic's requirements a lot easier.  

We had multiple team meetings during which we discussed the business case.  
We drew diagrams of how parts of the program were going to interact with each other.  
We also discussed how we are going to design the interface.  
I took pictures of both.  
After we analysed the problem I took the liberty of creating a project charter, work breakdown structure
(WBS) and software documentation.
